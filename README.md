# artGenerator
 This program generates "modern art" in a CLI using binary semaphores, shared memory, and parent/child processes.

 Adapted from an assignment for my Systems Programming course (CSE 3183 at MSU). The width of the art and number-character pairs that make up the art are randomly generated by a child process and stored in a shared struct. The parent process reads the values from the shared struct and outputs each quantity of letters (as denoted within each pair) with the artsy formatting. Colors within the art are derived from ANSI color codes, based on the progression of ASCII values of the characters within the pairs.
 
 A makefile is included in this repo. Simply run "make", then "./artGenerator". Again, output is randomized, so run multiple times for more unique art pieces! Note that rand() is seeded by time, so I've found that running the program twice in the same second produces the same art.
